    Additional data can be passed to the request by giving
    *extra_data*, a dictionary of values.

    If not interrupted, the push will add a new version to the
    database, and will link all unversioned operations to that newly
    added version.

    If rejected, the push operation will raise a
    dbsync.client.push.PushRejected exception.

    By default, the *encode* function is ``json.dumps``, the *decode*
    function is ``json.loads``, and the *headers* are appropriate HTTP
    headers for JSON.

    *include_extensions* dictates whether the message will include
    model extensions or not.
